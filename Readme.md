Spectron demo in Electron
This demo project shows how to incorporate Spectron into your Electron applications. Using Spectron you can do end-to-end testing on your application to verify core pieces of functionality are correct.

The main Electron project was built on top of Electron's quick start repository.

This repository hosts the code for two blog posts regarding Spectron:
